# Proposal Template

## What it is:
- A generic and very basic template that you can follow for writing (drafting) project proposals.
- A simple document that highlights the overview of your project proposal without diving too deep into technical terms.
- A starting point for your project proposal if you don't have any idea where to begin with, or if there was no formal or official documentation format given.

## What it is not:
- A substitute to any official documentation format given by any professors, for any projects under any subjects, unless stated otherwise.
- A full documentation of your project. This is a proposal template. Remember KISS. Keep It Short and Simple.

## Why?
The main reason why the author wrote this template is simply because he needs a better documentation format for himself. One that he can easily view, track (changes), and discuss, even if he's not inside the classroom.

Another reason is that he wants the students to get how it actually feels to work like an IT professional in the 21st century, having anywhere as their office, having anyone in the world to be their potential teammates, and having responsibilities on how to handle themselves on the duration of the project. Have a taste of the real thing, kids.

## How?
1. Clone this repository (recommended), or manually download the [proposal template](https://github.com/PUP-CCIS/proposal-template/blob/master/proposal.md).
2. When you already have a copy of the proposal template on your local machine, create another repository with the project proposal title as the repository name.
3. Copy `proposal.md` to the new repository and edit the details.
4. Push it to GitHub.
